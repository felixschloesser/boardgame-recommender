### Problem

The term "TasteModel" is used in the codebase, but it does not accurately describe the model's purpose. The model is focused on analyzing game-to-game similarities, not user-specific preferences or tastes. This terminology could cause confusion about the model's functionality.

### Proposed Solution

Rename "TasteModel" to a more accurate term such as:
- `GameSimilarityModel`
- `GameVectorModel`
- `SimilarityModel`

Update the code, configurations, and documentation accordingly.
